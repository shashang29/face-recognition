Highlights of the Project


• React’s ability to quickly update only the required parts of a page reduced page loading times compared
to traditional methods (server-side rendered MPA)

• Tachyons helped create fast loading, highly readable and super responsive interfaces with minimal
CSS

• Express saved development time with its ability to quickly create a skeleton server and build REST
API’s that return data from the PostgreSQL database

• Clarifai API and their machine learning model quickly returned analyzed photos, which created a
better user experience with short wait times between photo submission and seeing the results.


Technology used: React, Node, Express, REST API’s, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Clarifai API, Knex
